Fresh out of bootcamp, where do I go?
So many options, but really though? 
15 tabs on my Chrome and more to come
13 drafts of cover letters, please no more
Oh but don't forget the networks, they say they work

Hiring developers, but only "5+ years of experience"
Junior positions, but still says "2+ years requirement"
Okay, this is not working out great
So make a new plan and try again 

"Listen, I'm passionate", you say
"I love computers and video games", you claim
"I'm proficient in all these languages, I'm in love with development",
"Please read my cover letter", you pray 

One by one, you apply 
little by little, you realize you may cry
Your inbox says zero, so you replay the tape
It's a matter of time, you're not done yet

The answers will come, at some point
Keep up the pace and you'll find the place
Patience is key, be polite and stay hip (whatever that means)
The job will come, if you're persistent enough 


I thought it would be fun to do something a little different for this entry. 
I am experiencing this and I found the comedic side of it. 
It's fine that most web development jobs are requiring 3+ years of experience. 
It's okay if most entry level, jr. web development jobs are still asking for 2+ years...
Apply to them anyway, that's what I say. 
Make sure you have 80%, if not 90% or 100% of the requirements,
make sure it does make sense as a good fit for who you are and what you can do, make it realistic, don't go overboard, 
don't lie or they'll know, and then, finally, just apply with hope. 
Write to them, tell them why you want to work there, tell them why they'd love you there. 
Convince them. It's like you're selling yourself, in a good way. 

I'm trying, I have no networks, coming from a different country and living in a tiny town, but I'm trying. I will keep trying until I find that full-time position that will take me.

If you're here, it's because you want to do this. You want to change your life or your career or something else.
So, do it. Struggle and scramble and apply.
