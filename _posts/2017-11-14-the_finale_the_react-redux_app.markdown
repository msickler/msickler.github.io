Of all the projects, 100% this was the least stressful of them. 

This was thanks to the requirements being less restrictive, demanding or strict than the others. (Or maybe because you get better after all the hours of study? hm... maybe both.)

It makes sense that the program would end with a final project open to whatever you want to do. 

It's like the instructors and coaches are sitting there, across the table, looking at you and saying "Well, show us what you can do. Wow us."

They’re giving us that chance.

And that, in its own way, could have been even more nerve-racking than usual, because the whole weight of this project falls solely on your own decisions for it. But I decided not to take it like that. 

I wanted to make the sort of app I could fully develop by myself, make it great and not over-complicated. 

In other words, I didn't want to try doing the type of app a whole team of developers would be working on, or one where only a Senior developer would be assigned to do. 

You just have to learn to be humble. 
I'm not there yet (at Senior level) for obvious reasons, and that's okay.

Rather than having a massive app with hundreds of bugs because of "rookie mistakes" that ends up looking and feeling just not that great, I wanted to go for something I can do, code and control. 
Something that would be good, look good and be useful. 

I can't pretend I don't care for how it looks compared to how it works. 

I like CSS to the point where I respect it and can't help but hate my apps if they don't look good. 

As a matter of fact, for all of them, after setting minimal base structure, I worked on themes and templates for hours before even going to the content. 

I’m more motivated to work on an app when it looks good. Makes sense, right?

If anything, it's appropriate to be a Full Stack web developer that cares for both, front and back end. 

I focused on the user experience too. 
“How easy is the app to navigate and control?” Ok, make it easier. Faster too. 
That's actually a great thing I noticed with React. I don't know how it can get any faster than that. 

My app is BookShelf, a virtual library for books. 
People that like reading, or collect books, or just appreciate a good collection of books would hopefully appreciate it. 
It's an app to nicely and neatly store your books, any books you want. 
You can mark them as completed or not, you can rate them, and you can add a nice book cover for them.

I'm actually going to use it for myself, so I can have all my books in one page, since half of them are in Mexico, in my old home, and the other half is divided between the ones I have here, in my current home, and the ones that are with the libraries (or friends) I borrowed from. 

As my knowledge and experience grows, with time, I'll be coming back to this app to make it better. 

Update and upgrade. 

I enjoyed this project the most. 

I'm thankful there was so much freedom for it.
