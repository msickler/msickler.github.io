Something slightly funny happened here. We got the case of the chicken and the egg. 

I actually was done with the Sinatra Portfolio Project way before this CLI Project. It's easy to tell which should have come first, but here I am, with the chicken and no egg.

In Mexico (where I come from) we have a saying for this, "lento pero seguro", or "slowly but surely". 

It is not typically the way I function, because I like to get down to business and I can't stand being too slow, but I think for the level I was at, when I started this project, I chose an ambitious rode. 

I poured hours on end for so many days, and the hours would slip by like nothing. And the funniest thing, to that, is that my actual progress would be so minimal that I couldn't phantom how much time had gone compared to how slowly Google had answered my questions. 

And yes, I had plenty of questions. My questions parented questions. The children questions nested questions and each of those nested questions was an array of hashes of questions with alien keys and nonexistent answers. And some questions would loop over an instance of a question. And let's not forget the global questions no one wants, "what is even going on here", "what is this", "where is this", "$what". 

Yeah. I've forgotten all of them, because clearly I somehow figured it out and, now that it's part of my knowledge, I don't remember what the question was. 

But coding is fun that way. 

Okay, what I was actually trying to do here, on this project, was create a Movie Finder. A fun Movie Finder. 
I was thinking to myself, well if I'm going to create something I definitely want to create something I want and like. 
Just like having kids really, make them only if you want them and like them. (It's a joke, sort of)

Well, as soon as the idea was born I knew exactly what I wanted it to do. 

My child, you're going to do what I'm always too lazy to do, what I never have time to do and what I take too long to get done, all at the same time. 

You're going to list me movies, depending on what mood your mother is feeling. You know, my mood is your genre. 
You're going to list me only the best of the best, from the website your mother trusts so much (I actually have a bookmarks folder filled with movies certified fresh to watch someday) and you're going to keep the info short. I don't really care about all the little details, I just want to pick something good to watch. 

If I ask, I want you to get me a movie synopsis, I don't want to have to go and Google it, you do it, my child.
Also, if I feel like it, I want to say -what- and you tell me all the titles that have -what- in them. Like, if I'm feeling watching something that includes "flower" or "love" in the title you tell me what that is. 

And lastly, and the best feature I taught my child (in my opinion), I want you to choose for me. I mean, my boyfriend wont ("anything you want", he says), so you do it for me, please and thank you. 

I think you can tell I enjoyed this project, because I absolutely did, even when I felt like pulling my hair out. 
I think I could have been more "organized", in the way pros would, with the process, but I went more for a type of “organized” that newbies believe is organized and don't realize it's a mess until later.

It's ok, we're here to learn. 

But just so you get an idea, I wrote all the code for all my classes before ever testing it. I started stubbing out the structure and soon I had written a code for everything (the wrong code in many cases). 

Now, after that and once I wanted to test it, I found out my gemfile wasn't valid. I kept getting this errors in red that I couldn't understand. I tried Google... I tried comparing my gemfile with others, I tried deleting it and my gemspec and re-writing it. I tried, more than once, going to Avi's examples in videos and copy-pasting the whole gemspec, then tailoring it to fit my child... Nothing! Not valid. 

This lasted for some days (and it is how I moved on and kept learning the next lessons until I eventually reached the Sinatra project, my second child whom I also love and whom somehow managed to fully develop into a ripe, young adult before my first child even hit puberty... my poor first born, we always fail all the tests with them, we bring them up by trial-and-error --this also applies to my mother and I by the way--)...

But anyhow, back to the point. 
I sat down one day and said, I'm not getting up until this works, I can't wait until the appointment for the 1:1, and what am I going to tell them? 
"My gem isn't even valid so I can't do much teehee", no. 

I tried many things, but I'm pretty sure what finally got things working was deleting the gemfile.lock (which I had forgotten about) then cleaning the gemspec word by word, then saving. 

The rest is history. 

I don't know, I think I love my CLI Project, he's a slow learner but he has a strong heart.
