I never really noticed JQuery was there until I started coding it. 

Now that I know what it is, I keep seeing it being used everywhere I go online.

I'd say it's similar to central AC in a house. You use it all the time, it's there in the background making things nicer. 
If it breaks, it's immediately top priority to fix it, because once you have installed it, it's not something your house can do without. 

Websites are just much better with it. To me it's like, if there are cool, free features that make navigating your app smoother and faster, why wouldn't you implemt it? 

Again, just like central AC. Where I come from in Mexico, it's not really a thing yet and I was cool with that, but now that I've lived in the US, I would never willingly give up the AC. 

This project took me a good amount of time, and I think it was because I was, in a way, amazed by what an app could do with JavaScript and JQuery that I had too many ideas, too big for my experience level.

I had to get more specific. What is this page actually going to do? What functions do I need?

At first, I jumped right in without too much of a plan, but I went back to re-do things slowly and more carefully. 
Making sure every feature was working. 

I found myself googling coding questions almost every 5 minutes, maybe more or less, but it's become a thing now to have a million tabs open to see how to do this, how to code that, some examples, some tutorials... 

But I like that, Google really never runs out of answers. 

Thank god for the internet and its infinite amount of information. 

The coding community seems to be larger than I could imagine, I'm starting to really appreciate it. 

Anyway, back to the project, here is what I learned. 
You can't remember everything, so just look it up.
It's good to go through the lessons again, and again, if you need to. 
Most of all, do a proper sketch or draft of what your app is going to do or be, before you start. Outline it and keep it organized from the beginning. It'll help.
