To begin with, as bad as it may sound, I didn't even realize coding was a career with its hundreds of variations and branches, not for a while. 
I used to think of people who coded as the Hollywood stereotype for hackers. A lonely, smart, serious guy in a dark room with 2 to 5 monitors in front of him. Then I entered university and found out there was a whole branch in that university dedicated to coding careers, but I saw, or thought I saw, only men there. Cool guys, or strange ones, but always very smart. I didn't think much of it. Like mechanical engineering, I never considered the possibility that it was something I wanted to do or that it was something girls could do. I come from a very old-school city, so it's easy to understand why we would think like that. 
I studied Organizational Psychology, my classes were mostly filled with girls and the jobs we could hope for were working in HR departments. Well, I ended up working in customer service first, then hospitality. And I was doing good there, but it didn't take too long to realize it wasn't, at all, what I wanted to do. 
It felt so easy and so draining at the same time, dealing with guests through the hospitality environment. 
If you're good at something it doesn't necessarily mean you should be doing it. It just means you're good at it, but maybe there's something else you could be good at. 
I felt that and like I was wasting my brain in things that didn't matter to me (such as, sending a bottle of wine, handwritten letter and a selection of cheeses to a couple celebrating their anniversary so they could have the trip of their dreams and give the luxury hotel 5 stars...). And like I could be doing more. 
By coincidence, I met a friend of a friend that worked in web development, office hours only, making way more than what I made, working with a team of people she liked in different projects... 
That made me start looking into web development for myself. 
Turns out, it's not just for men, it's not just for geniuses (if you put in the effort) and it could pay much better. I'm not saying money is my motivation, but my family in Mexico needs it and I could finally return them all the favors for raising me, if I could help. It's also a dream for me to be financially independent. 
I tried out free online courses, videos and went through a lot of bootcamps, trying to find the correct one for me. 
Since Flatiron lets me learn at my pace and study from home, with a great reputation of actually working (for its students) too... It wasn't hard to decide. 
I quit my job to study full-time. I don't have time to waste, everything I had been saving up from my previous jobs is supporting me right now, and it won't last forever. 
I like this, I get hooked in it for hours... so this is what I'm doing now.
