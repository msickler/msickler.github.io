It makes me think of the the movie Live Die Repeat (or Edge of Tomorrow), not for anything else other than the title.

Since I started this bootcamp my lifestyle has changed, pretty much entirely. 

I was working full-time before, afternoon and night shift. Really long, busy, fast-paced, shifts. On my feet for at least 8 hours straight. Getting home after midnight, right after work, falling asleep right away and waking up late, late breakfast, lots of takeout (for speed and convenience)... you get the idea. 

I quit all that though, to truly do a career and life change.

From day one here I set up alarm at 7.45 AM. I those 15 minutes to wake up and set up my study area, then I start. 
I keep track of my hours with my phone timer. 8 hours a day, at least, everyday. 

That's how it has been, and it's not as strict as it sounds. 
I'll pause the timer when I grab something to eat, when I go on some other website and get distracted, even when I have to run to the bathroom, to truly count 8 honest hours of work.

I was doing that before, at work, for something I wasn't passionate about, so why wouldn't I do that for this coding bootcamp? 
For what I'm personally choosing to put my money, time and mind in. 

I've noticed along with this study routine I've adopted new healthy habits. 

I wake up early every day now without the need for an alarm, I cook every single meal now, no takeout or fast food or even junk. 

I don't remember the last time I got a bag of chips and trust me, that used to be a weekly thing. 

Of course this is all related. 

Things change when you're doing something you like, something you want, but I think most of all, things change when you're working on your own personal goals. 

No one asked me to do this, or suggested it. It's all on me. Whatever the outcome is will be all on me as well. 

I honestly can't wait to complete the curriculum and continue with the next thing, start the job hunt, start working with a team...
