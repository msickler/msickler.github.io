First of all, you can't.

It's as easy as that, but it wasn't really as easy to come to terms with it. 

When I think about it, it makes sense why getting stuck when and with coding was so inevitably frustrating.

I can't think of anything else I've done or learned in life that was like this coding bootcamp. 

Learning at school, say during high school, even in your worst subjects like Physics or Chemistry, Algebra and what not, there was no 'getting stuck' there that could compare to what one goes through getting stuck here. 

For starters, you had classmates physically next to you, you could copy them, consult them, you knew each other, were close friends with some, and you could definitely just go do the homework together and somebody would have the answers. 

That aside, it was just school, your parents were paying for it, you had no bills to pay yourself (hopefully) and who cares? It's school, it's not like you are going to be doing all that for the rest of your life.

But this a career, so yes, we will be doing something like it for a big part of our lives. 

We're learning online too, so forget about the ideal classroom full of friends you know and get together with for homework. 

On top of that, it's full stack web development, it's not like learning to speak French. (I've done that and it's definitely not as challenging)

It's a lot of problem solving, logic, and there is no absolute answer, there's plenty, but who knows from the pool of 'plenty' how many could actually apply to your specific scenario or project. 

There is so much information out there on the web. The internet holds all our answers, but they're not easy to find or clear to understand, and most likely the answer is split at least four-ways in separate websites. 
Each helping you with one little step at a time. 

We have instructors, yes, but we can't really expect them to give us undivided attention. Sadly. 

It's not like my teachers in high school that handled about 50 students at a time and we had them right there, in front of our faces. I could walk into their office and ask. Easy as that. 

But online everybody has their own schedules, everybody is in their own world, and that is fine. But it doesn't help when you feel stuck. 

Okay, so what is one supposed to do? 

Well figure it out, of course. 
Yourself. 

Go look for the answer, keep trying, keep testing, scratch the whole thing out and start again, check and triple-check for typos, what did you forget to wire-up? set-up? define? declare? require? is the logic broken? is the whole thing wrong? what am I even doing? Why is this not working? 

It reminds me of my hair knots. 

I have naturally curly hair and it tangles and knots like crazy. It takes time to straighten out. 
Sometimes it feels like I'm ripping my hair out, sometimes I just approach the combing very carefully and patiently, other times, when I much younger, I would take out my scissors and cut the whole problem off. (I don't recommend it, but it does the job)

Well, 'getting stuck' with your coding feels like that, sometimes. 

Although it depends on your case, the best approach tends to be the careful, patient combing through. 
Hair by hair. Line by line, inspect it. Look at it, ask it work nicely. Look up tricks to detangle frizzy hair. 
Add some coconut oil maybe. Get the right tools. The right comb. And stay patient.
