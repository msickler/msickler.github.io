This is what I created, if you'd like to look on [Github](https://github.com/msickler/japan_seeings/tree/master/japan-seeings)

Before anything else, the big question was nothing more than this: What do I make? What do I want to make? What would be fun but also meet the requirements?

Right, I looked at the the two examples given, looking for inspiration and found zero. But, somewhere in the project it brought up the word "travel" and that's where my idea came to me. 

I love to travel, yes, but more specifically, I love traveling to Japan. I went there this last January, first time. I'm slightly (slightly) considered a controlling lady and I like things, in general, in a very particular way. So you can imagine having my big dream trip to Japan, how it was scrutinized down to what perfumed hand sanitizer I was going to bring with me to be carrying around... I took my time organizing the trip, about 2 months. 
There is so much to do in Japan and it is impossible to fit every supposed "must" spot in one trip. You really have to make your decisions on what matters to you and what you really want to see, but at the same time it's not like I was an expert and knew what I wanted to see most, because I had never been there. I relied so much on the opinions of strangers of the internet to plan my itineraries. Some were youtubers, others were bloggers... some where paid to say certain things or promote certain places. Some spots are overhyped and others, underrated. So, you see where my idea really came from. 

For the Sinatra project I made this simple, straight-forward web app, a community for people that really want to see Japan to get plain old basic data. Where are people going? How much do they like it? What do they say about it? It doesnâ€™t really matter who says what and how many likes they get and it's not meant to plan a trip for you, it's merely a sort of anonymous board where it's "less talk and more action". You get to see what members liked better or less. You can also use the app for yourself, go on your board and have a neat list of all the spots you already hit so you can cross them off your list. 

I enjoyed building this project and I had fun playing with the CSS to make things nicer, a bit at a time. 
For my first real Sinatra project, I quite like it.
