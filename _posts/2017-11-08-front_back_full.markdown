I believe we believe things are easier to grasp when we keep them inside their own, labelled boxes. 

Here go the apples, here go the oranges, here go the bananas. 
Nicer than having a pantry with the bananas next to the soy sauce next to the bag of chips next to the flour. 

I thought that was what Front and Back end was. This and that. And fullstack being more of a ‘little bit of this and little of that, but not enough of either’. 

Well, I've changed my mind. It's not exactly like that.

The front end takes care of the web design and some front end development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and probably Photoshop as well. 

The backend is what I consider the tough parts. 

If Front end was the design, furnishing, walls, lights, gates, floors, carpets, rugs… in a home, the backend would be the actual structure, the actual walls, not the color you see in them. The plumbing, the actual electrics, the gas set-up, the AC working. 
All the components that make a home a good home, sturdy walls and roof, hopefully some soundproofing, AC and heating, warm shower water, a working dishwasher… 

Then Full Stack, well, you have to learn both. 

I haven’t experienced this work industry yet, so I can’t say for sure, but I think if you study Full Stack development, you will lean one way more than the other, you will choose your preferences and try to work more in that area, front or back. But you will still have the knowledge and understanding of the other, so that, when needed, you can use it. 

I haven’t decided if I want to go one way or the other, or pursue a full stack web developer kind of job, but I do know two things. 

One, I love working with  the design aspect of a project, with CSS and I have been happily working with Photoshop for some years too. 

Two, I can really get into a Ruby on Rails app, the relationships between the models that might as well be a soap opera of love affairs, and simply the fact that I can create a working app with whatever ideas come to me. 

I love that ‘creation’ part. 

It’s just like the right and left brain halves. How the left half is about logical thinking, facts and math while the right half is about intuition, imagination and arts. 

People say one is stronger than the other in every person. 

Sometimes it’s very clear which hemisphere is the one ruling over the other, just by observing a person or knowing a friend, understanding a personality. 
Even working in teams, if you pay attention you can tell what type of person others are. 

And this distinction is a good thing, because if you are better at something than other, then do that something. Or if you prefer something over another, then please go ahead. 

Alright, I’ve always been more of a right brain hemisphere. I can’t shut off my imagination most of the time. It’s so active my dreams are 90% vivid sci-fi movies. I write fiction and poetry. And I love the design aspect of coding. 

So, who knows? Maybe I’ll be leaning towards front end development. 

However, even if I decided to go that way, I’d never want to lose what I’ve learned. And I still want to be able to create an idea, make it a real app and be able to put my name in it. 

It’s like learning this full stack web development course has made me greedy.

I want to be good at both sides of the coin and develop both halves of my brain, but I also want to be particularly good at web design, while maintaning the best, creative ideas for new projects… 

So, basically I want it all. Nothings wrong with that.
Bring in the motivation.
